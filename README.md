    teleporting between ships
    repairing ships and tonnage
    Remove Flyby, maybe make MO ability

Notes from the Treantmonk:

    Balance and stuffs
        ship repair
            Use existing repair model from 5e DMG
            add hit dice stat and divide by 4.5 to get hit dice for ships
            airship - 66 hit dice, short rest/long rest rules
            short rest - away from dock, long rest - at dock only
            long rest only at civilized port, and able to recover hit dice

    Ships
        describe each ship in a paragraph or two
        reach to the community and try to get someone to donate artwork, to keep creative commons/free art theme

    Crew members
        Change stats for the crew - make each one of them different
        green crew is good, don't change
        make trained crew stats better
            give other proficiencies - proficency in the weapons and armor they're using
            up the AC with better armor and give them proficency
        make crack crew really good, maybe base stats off for a knight
            give them expertise in vehicles
            increase physical stats
            better hit dice
            even better armor, half-plate or something
            a ship being repaired by crack crew, repair takes even less time
            A lot of docks need guarding. Crew is kept busy when in dock. Maintenance and stuff - refilling the hit dice
            standard practice is to keep an "away team"

    Stations
        90% the way it is
        scale back first mate, give bonuses not blanket advantage
        add in general actions anyone can take, little bonuses, feel like something is better than nothing

    Phlogiston
        Remove instantaneous double damage for fire spells, maybe just a +1 dice or something.

    Maps
        Hex vs square
            Facing sorta needs to happen
            Have "standard" be square, use alternate for hexes
            With a square grid, your first facing is free and every other facing costs cost one speed point
            Alternate rules for hex grids - Take out adding the 1 free movement for square grids - all hex facings changes cost one movement

    Helms are insanely expensive - soften costs for helms - or - - material costs for create helm include the phrase "which the spell consumes" - have it use gold dust or diamond worth 1000gp or something similar - or both - - Helms - very rare - pg 135 dmg - like 25k gp or something similar - create helm - concentration up to a day - add costs for everything else

    For 30 Hull Points worth of repair - With an unskilled peasant hitting wood with a hammer and jamming it in the boat with straw and tar, that's 30 days and 500gp. With a skilled laborer doing it herself out in the wilderness with tools and resources it's 30 hours and 750 gp of materials. With the same skilled laborer and a Mending cantrip - 15 hours and 750 gp of materials; With a 4th level Fabricate it's 10 hours and 750 gp of materials. At a port, it's 1500 gp and 30 hours, and you are free to do whatever you want in town cause the ship is being fixed by other people.

    Include rules how to build a vessel as a second supplement

    Pgs 128-129 has costs for a stronghold and making magic items

    use ship stuff from http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/ships-and-sea
